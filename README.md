# Image-Editor
Image editor using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

When we open the application we will be prompted with a card and we can chose an image from our computer.

EX:
![image](https://github.com/brzTudor/Image-Editor/assets/100021158/34ef6bce-cc23-4f6c-b65b-8a081799625f)

Afterwards we can chose different styles to edit the image like modify the brightness, saturation, inversion or grayscale using a slider.

EX:
![image](https://github.com/brzTudor/Image-Editor/assets/100021158/eff659c2-f6ea-4397-9b88-1ab55196b5d4)

Other filters are flipping the image by 90 degrees, left to right or up and down.

EX:
![image](https://github.com/brzTudor/Image-Editor/assets/100021158/d743ed29-bbeb-4f38-b0a9-34106bbd2cab)

When we are done editing, we can chose to save the image in our computer or reset the filters using the buttons.
